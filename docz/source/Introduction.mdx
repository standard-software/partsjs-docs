# Introduction

## Parts.js 

- Parts.js is a JavaScript type-safe library for many platforms.

- We have implemented a lot of that namespace everyone thinks "I wish I had something like this".

- The code is highly readable, so it's easy to use as a reference for your implementation or by copying and pasting your implementation.

- Parts.js is implemented simply without depending on other libraries.

- Since the code uses contract programming method or defensive programming method, an error is output when making an argument call with a wrong type.

## partsjs-docs

docz and gatsby are used to create partsjs-docs.

The author is Japanese and not fluent in English, so I use google translate and manual translation to create this document.

I'm sorry if there is something strange about the expression in the text. I would appreciate it if you could let me know.
